### **About**

~ At first, this project was started with the name of Embargo Breaker.

- During a rewrite, it was decided to change the name of the program to Shield, and now you have a completely advanced
version of C-Shark.

- With C-Shark, internet sanctions in Iran (at least) are bypassed.

    - Currently, it is a pre-release version, and it is not stable, but a stable release will be provided soon...
    - Forking and helping to develop the project is your favor so that we can progress together 🙏🏻.
    - I am interested in your suggestions or providing important points from you.
