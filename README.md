# `C-SHARK`

~ At first, this project was started with the name of Embargo Breaker.

During a rewrite, it was decided to change the name of the program to Shield, and now you have a completely advanced
version of CShark Space.

With C-SHARK, internet sanctions in Iran (at least) are bypassed.

+ Currently, it is a pre-release version and it is not stable, but a stable release will be provided soon...
Forking and helping to develop the project is your favor so that we can progress togather 🙏🏻.
  I am interested in your suggestions or providing important points from you.

### [Contribute](https://github.com/b-daarr/C-SHARK/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

**How Can I Contribute?**

+ Reporting Bugs
  
> Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/b-daarr/C-SHARK/issues).
> If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

+ Suggesting Enhancements
  
> Search the existing [Issues](https://github.com/b-daarr/C-SHARK/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested.
> If it hasn't, open a new issue and describe the enhancement you'd like to see, why you think it would be beneficial, and any implementation ideas you have.

+ Pull Requests

> Fork the repository.
>
> Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
> 
> Make your changes.
> 
> Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
> 
> Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
> 
> Open a Pull Request.

**Style Guides**

+ Git Commit Messages
  
> Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
> 
> Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
> 
> Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
> 
> Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

+ Code Style
  
> Follow the coding style conventions of the project.
> Ensure your code passes all tests.

Be patient and respectful in all communications.
Thank you for contributing! 🙌
